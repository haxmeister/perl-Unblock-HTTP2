=head1 NAME

Unblock::HTTP2 - non-blocking HTTP/2 protocol engine for Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Unblock::HTTP2::Server;

    my $server = Unblock::HTTP2::Server->new(
        transport => $framework_stream,
        on_request => sub {
            my ($tx, $request) = @_;
            $tx->respond(status => 200, body => "Hello World!\n");
        },
    );

    $server->input($decrypted_http2_bytes);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Unblock::HTTP2 is an HTTP/2 protocol engine.

It handles HTTP/2 framing, HPACK, multiplexed streams, SETTINGS, flow control,
PING, GOAWAY, trailers, CONNECT, and RFC 9218 priority signaling.

It does not own sockets, TLS, ALPN, an event loop, connection pooling, or retry
policy.

HTTP messages are L<Uniform::HTTP::Request> and
L<Uniform::HTTP::Response> objects.

libnghttp2 is used through a small private XS binding contained in this
distribution.

=head1 MODULES

=over 4

=item L<Unblock::HTTP2::Integration>

How to attach an event-framework stream.

=item L<Unblock::HTTP2::Client>

One client HTTP/2 connection.

=item L<Unblock::HTTP2::Server>

One server HTTP/2 connection.

=item L<Unblock::HTTP2::Transaction>

One HTTP request/response transaction carried by an HTTP/2 stream.

=item L<Unblock::HTTP2::NativeABI>

Optional native transport ABI for XS-backed integrations.

=head1 ERROR CODES

The standard HTTP/2 error codes are available as package constants, including
C<NO_ERROR>, C<PROTOCOL_ERROR>, C<REFUSED_STREAM>, and C<CANCEL>.

C<error_name($code)> returns the symbolic name for a known code.

=head1 TRANSPORT BOUNDARY

Create a Client or Server with C<transport =E<gt> $framework_stream>.
The framework provides C<unblock_send()>, C<unblock_finish()>, and
C<unblock_abort()>. Feed received bytes with C<input()>. The engine
automatically delivers outgoing HTTP/2 bytes to the framework.

The previous manual C<want_write()> and C<output()> interface remains
available without an attached transport.

XS-backed transports can instead use L<Unblock::HTTP2::NativeABI>
for borrowed input and native output sinks.

For a complete description of callbacks, backpressure, EOF, and shutdown,
see L<Unblock::HTTP2::Integration>.
